# jaxoplanet *case studies*

_Real-world applications of jaxoplanet for astronomical data analysis_

---

These pages contain "case studies" for `jaxoplanet`. They are implemented as 
Jupyter notebooks, and you can download the
notebook or launch it using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) using the menus at the top
right of each case study.

For more information about `jaxoplanet`, check out the main documentation page
at [jaxoplanet](https://jax.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/).

```{hint}

‚è∞ Note that the runtime for some of these notebooks can be as long as half an
hour, but we've tried to keep the studies as self-contained and reproducible
as possible. This computation is generally dominated by the sampling step so
if you want to get a rough sense of the expected runtime for a particular
case study, scroll down to take a look at the progress bar generated by the
call to the `sample` function.

üí° If you have a conceptual issue or a particularly tricky or interesting
fit, [start a discussion](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/jaxoplanet/discussions) 
on GitHub so that we can all learn together. Each case study is an example of a real world
application of the [jaxoplanet](https://jax.exoplanet.codes/en/latest/) 

üêõ If you run into bugs when executing these case studies (or variations on
them) on your own computer, [open an issue on the exoplanet GitHub repo]
(https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/jaxoplanet/discussions).
